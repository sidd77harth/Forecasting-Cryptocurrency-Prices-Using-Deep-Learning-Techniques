# Forecasting-Cryptocurrency-Prices-Using-Deep-Learning-Techniques
Cryptocurrency price prediction by exploring three advanced deep-learning architectures: LSTM, GRU, and Bi-LSTM.
The conclusion of the study is that deep learning algorithms are effective in predicting cryptocurrency prices, and that the Bi-LSTM model is more efficient in predicting cryptocurrency prices than traditional LSTM and GRU. In future studies, the effect of tweets and sentiments on cryptocurrency prices will be explored using machine learning techniques.
